## Installation
To be able to interact with this project you need to :

- Press green code button above, then choose the Download ZIP option. A file should be download which means that the project is in your PC now.
- Then you should install XAMPP. In simple words, XAMPP is an easy to install option to run PHP on the Web as it contains Apache (web server) and MySQL (database). To download the latest version of XAMPP click [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).If you find it hard to install XAMPP, click [here](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/) for some useful installation instructions.
- Once you have installed XAMPP, go to the folder where it is installed, then go inside the htdocs folder. In windows the default path is usually this C:\xampp\htdocs. Inside the htdocs folder you want to create an empty folder named Project. Inside the folder that you have created you should drop all the files that are located inside the ZIP file you downloaded at first.
- After you have done that, open XAMPP control panel, through windows search and press the start buttons of the first two modules Apache and MySQL. Then press the admin button of MySQL module. It will open a page for you called phpmyadmin where you need to create a new database with a name epignosis-library and after you create it you will need to import the epignosis-library.sql file from the folder you created. Click [here](https://help.one.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005588189-How-do-I-import-a-database-to-phpMyAdmin-) for instructions on how to import a sql file on a database with phpmyadmin.
- Finally, if all of the above where excecuted correctly, you can go back to XAMPP control panel and press the admin button of Apache module. It will open a page with this href [http://localhost/dashboard/]([http://localhost/dashboard/]). All you need now is to change the href to [http://localhost/Project/]([http://localhost/Project/]).
